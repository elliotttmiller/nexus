/sandbox/processor_token/create	Bypass the Link flow for creating an Item for a processor partner
/sandbox/item/reset_login	Trigger the ITEM_LOGIN_REQUIRED state for an Item
/sandbox/user/reset_login	(Income and Check) Force Item(s) for a Sandbox user into an error state
/sandbox/item/fire_webhook	Fire a specific webhook
/sandbox/item/set_verification_status	(Auth) Set a verification status for testing micro-deposits
/sandbox/transfer/fire_webhook	(Transfer) Fire a specific webhook
/sandbox/transfer/ledger/deposit/simulate	(Transfer) Simulate a deposit sweep event
/sandbox/transfer/ledger/simulate_available	(Transfer) Simulate converting pending balance into available balance
/sandbox/transfer/ledger/withdraw/simulate	(Transfer) Simulate a withdraw sweep event
/sandbox/transfer/simulate	(Transfer) Simulate a transfer event
/sandbox/transfer/refund/simulate	(Transfer) Simulate a refund event
/sandbox/transfer/sweep/simulate	(Transfer) Simulate a transfer sweep event
/sandbox/transfer/test_clock/create	(Transfer) Create a test clock for testing recurring transfers

/sandbox/cra/cashflow_updates/update	(Check) Simulate an update for Cash Flow Updates
/sandbox/payment/simulate	(Payment Initiation) Simulate a payment
/sandbox/transactions/create	(Transactions) Create custom transactions for Items
/sandbox/public_token/create
Create a test Item
Use the /sandbox/public_token/create endpoint to create a valid public_token for an arbitrary institution ID, initial products, and test credentials. The created public_token maps to a new Sandbox Item. You can then call /item/public_token/exchange to exchange the public_token for an access_token and perform all API actions. /sandbox/public_token/create can also be used with the user_custom test username to generate a test account with custom data, or with Plaid's pre-populated Sandbox test accounts.

/sandbox/item/reset_login
Force a Sandbox Item into an error state
/sandbox/item/reset_login/ forces an Item into an ITEM_LOGIN_REQUIRED state in order to simulate an Item whose login is no longer valid. This makes it easy to test Link's update mode flow in the Sandbox environment. After calling /sandbox/item/reset_login, You can then use Plaid Link update mode to restore the Item to a good state. An ITEM_LOGIN_REQUIRED webhook will also be fired after a call to this endpoint, if one is associated with the Item.
In the Sandbox, Items will transition to an ITEM_LOGIN_REQUIRED error state automatically after 30 days, even if this endpoint is not called.

Request fields

client_id
string
Your Plaid API client_id. The client_id is required and may be provided either in the PLAID-CLIENT-ID header or as part of a request body.
secret
string

/sandbox/user/reset_login/ functions the same as /sandbox/item/reset_login, but will modify Items related to a User. This endpoint forces each Item into an ITEM_LOGIN_REQUIRED state in order to simulate an Item whose login is no longer valid. This makes it easy to test Link's update mode flow in the Sandbox environment. After calling /sandbox/user/reset_login, You can then use Plaid Link update mode to restore Items associated with the User to a good state. An ITEM_LOGIN_REQUIRED webhook will also be fired after a call to this endpoint, if one is associated with the Item.

/sandbox/item/fire_webhook
Fire a test webhook
The /sandbox/item/fire_webhook endpoint is used to test that code correctly handles webhooks. This endpoint can trigger the following webhooks:
DEFAULT_UPDATE: Webhook to be fired for a given Sandbox Item simulating a default update event for the respective product as specified with the webhook_type in the request body. Valid Sandbox DEFAULT_UPDATE webhook types include: AUTH, IDENTITY, TRANSACTIONS, INVESTMENTS_TRANSACTIONS, LIABILITIES, HOLDINGS. If the Item does not support the product, a SANDBOX_PRODUCT_NOT_ENABLED error will result.
NEW_ACCOUNTS_AVAILABLE: Fired to indicate that a new account is available on the Item and you can launch update mode to request access to it.
SMS_MICRODEPOSITS_VERIFICATION: Fired when a given same day micro-deposit item is verified via SMS verification.
LOGIN_REPAIRED: Fired when an Item recovers from the ITEM_LOGIN_REQUIRED without the user going through update mode in your app.
PENDING_DISCONNECT: Fired when an Item will stop working in the near future (e.g. due to a planned bank migration) and must be sent through update mode to continue working.
RECURRING_TRANSACTIONS_UPDATE: Recurring Transactions webhook to be fired for a given Sandbox Item. If the Item does not support Recurring Transactions, a SANDBOX_PRODUCT_NOT_ENABLED error will result.
SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE: Transactions webhook to be fired for a given Sandbox Item. If the Item does not support Transactions, a SANDBOX_PRODUCT_NOT_ENABLED error will result.
PRODUCT_READY: Assets webhook to be fired when a given asset report has been successfully generated. If the Item does not support Assets, a SANDBOX_PRODUCT_NOT_ENABLED error will result.
ERROR: Assets webhook to be fired when asset report generation has failed. If the Item does not support Assets, a SANDBOX_PRODUCT_NOT_ENABLED error will result.
USER_PERMISSION_REVOKED: Indicates an end user has revoked the permission that they previously granted to access an Item. May not always fire upon revocation, as some institutions’ consent portals do not trigger this webhook. Upon receiving this webhook, it is recommended to delete any stored data from Plaid associated with the account or Item.
USER_ACCOUNT_REVOKED: Fired when an end user has revoked access to their account on the Data Provider's portal. This webhook is currently sent only for Chase and PNC Items, but may be sent in the future for other financial institutions. Upon receiving this webhook, it is recommended to delete any stored data from Plaid associated with the account or Item.
Note that this endpoint is provided for developer ease-of-use and is not required for testing webhooks; webhooks will also fire in Sandbox under the same conditions that they would in Production (except for webhooks of type TRANSFER).

/sandbox/transfer/test_clock/advance
Advance a test clock
Use the /sandbox/transfer/test_clock/advance endpoint to advance a test_clock in the Sandbox environment.
A test clock object represents an independent timeline and has a virtual_time field indicating the current timestamp of the timeline. A test clock can be advanced by incrementing virtual_time, but may never go back to a lower virtual_time.
If a test clock is advanced, we will simulate the changes that ought to occur during the time that elapsed.
For example, a client creates a weekly recurring transfer with a test clock set at t. When the client advances the test clock by setting virtual_time = t + 15 days, 2 new originations should be created, along with the webhook events.
The advancement of the test clock from its current virtual_time should be limited such that there are no more than 20 originations resulting from the advance operation on each recurring_transfer associated with the test_clock.
For example, if the recurring transfer associated with this test clock originates once every 4 weeks, you can advance the virtual_time up to 80 weeks on each API call.

Core lifecycle statuses:
PAYMENT_STATUS_INPUT_NEEDED: Transitional. The payment is awaiting user input to continue processing. It may re-enter this state if additional input is required.
PAYMENT_STATUS_AUTHORISING: Transitional. The payment is being authorised by the financial institution. It will automatically move on once authorisation completes.
PAYMENT_STATUS_INITIATED: Transitional. The payment has been authorised and accepted by the financial institution and is now in transit. A payment should be considered complete once it reaches the PAYMENT_STATUS_EXECUTED state or the funds settle in the recipient account.
PAYMENT_STATUS_EXECUTED: Terminal. The funds have left the payer’s account and the payment is en route to settlement. Support is more common in the UK than in the EU; where unsupported, a successful payment remains in PAYMENT_STATUS_INITIATED before settling. When using Plaid Virtual Accounts, PAYMENT_STATUS_EXECUTED is not terminal—the payment will continue to PAYMENT_STATUS_SETTLED once funds are available.
PAYMENT_STATUS_SETTLED: Terminal. The funds are available in the recipient’s account. Only available to customers using Plaid Virtual Accounts.
Failure statuses:
PAYMENT_STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS: Terminal. The payment failed due to insufficient funds. No further retries will succeed until the payer’s balance is replenished.
PAYMENT_STATUS_FAILED: Terminal (retryable). The payment could not be initiated due to a system error or outage. Retry once the root cause is resolved.
PAYMENT_STATUS_BLOCKED: Terminal (retryable). The payment was blocked by Plaid (e.g., flagged as risky). Resolve any compliance or risk issues and retry.
PAYMENT_STATUS_REJECTED: Terminal. The payment was rejected by the financial institution. No automatic retry is possible.
PAYMENT_STATUS_CANCELLED: Terminal. The end user cancelled the payment during authorisation.
Standing-order statuses:
PAYMENT_STATUS_ESTABLISHED: Terminal. A recurring/standing order has been successfully created.
Deprecated (to be removed in a future release):
PAYMENT_STATUS_UNKNOWN: The payment status is unknown.
PAYMENT_STATUS_PROCESSING: The payment is currently being processed.
