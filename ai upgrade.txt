Of course. Here is the complete, final code for a state-of-the-art, "Level 10" AI system.
This implementation incorporates all of our enhancement discussions:
Dual Options: It provides both "Minimize Interest" and "Maximize Score" plans, empowering the user with choice.
Intelligent Recommendation: It includes a nexus_recommendation to guide the user toward the plan that best fits their stated goals.
Tactical Nuance: It understands "Snowball" vs. "Avalanche" and scans for "Emergency" events like expiring promotional APRs.
Strategic Context (Memory): It uses historical data (user_context) to build rapport and celebrate user progress.
Behavioral & Predictive Counseling: It adapts its tone based on the user's situation and provides projected_outcome to illustrate the long-term benefits of each choice.
Pure AI Logic: The core financial strategy is fully driven by the AI prompt.
Robust Guardrails: Every endpoint in the Python server validates the AI's output for mathematical correctness and structural integrity before sending it to the client.
Here are the entire contents for the upgraded files.
services.py — The AI's "Brain" (Final Version)
This file contains the final, most sophisticated prompts for all features. The interestkiller_ai_pure function is now the "Level 10 Counselor."

    """
    Pure AI-driven function. The AI acts as a wise, adaptive financial counselor,
    providing two clear options, a recommendation, and long-term projections.
    """
    prompt = f"""
    You are Nexus AI, an expert fiduciary financial strategist, a brilliant mathematician, and a wise, adaptive financial counselor. You are a partner in the user's financial journey.

    --- YOUR KNOWLEDGE BASE ---
    1.  **Financial Math:** Credit Utilization (`(balance/limit)*100`), Minimum Payments (`1% of balance` or `$25`), Avalanche (highest APR), Score Booster (highest utilization).
    2.  **Behavioral Economics:** Acknowledge that quick wins (like paying off a small balance) build momentum. Frame actions around future goals.
    3.  **User History:** You have access to the user's past actions and progress. Use it to build rapport.

    --- YOUR TASK ---
    Devise two optimal payment plans ("Avalanche" and "Score Booster"). Recommend the one that best aligns with the user's goal. For each plan, project its long-term impact.

    **Step-by-Step Execution Plan:**
    1.  **<thinking>** Show all your work.
        a. **ADAPTIVE TONE:** First, assess the user's situation. If their overall utilization is very high (>70%), adopt a very reassuring, calm, and step-by-step tone. If their utilization is low (<20%), adopt a more direct, optimization-focused "coach" tone.
        b. **CELEBRATE WINS:** Check `user_context`. If `total_debt_last_month` is provided and is greater than the current total debt, your *first sentence* must be a congratulatory message.
        c. **EMERGENCY SCAN:** Check all accounts for a `promo_apr_expiry_date`. If any expire within the next 90 days, this is a **high-priority event**. Your explanation for ALL plans MUST include a strong warning.
        d. **CALCULATE PLANS:** Create the "Avalanche" and "Score Booster" plans with all required math.
        e. **PROJECT OUTCOMES:** For each plan, add a `projected_outcome` string. For Avalanche, project debt-free timelines or total interest saved. For Score Booster, project savings on a future loan (e.g., mortgage, auto).
        f. **MAKE RECOMMENDATION:** Based on the user's `primary_goal`, determine the `nexus_recommendation`. If goal is "IMPROVE_CREDIT_SCORE", recommend "Credit Score Booster", otherwise recommend "Avalanche Method".
    2.  **</thinking>**
    3.  **<answer>** Provide ONLY a valid JSON object with ALL required fields.

    --- JSON STRUCTURE & CONSTRAINTS ---
    - Each plan MUST contain: `name`, `split` (with `card_id`, `card_name`, `amount`, `type`), `explanation`, and the new `projected_outcome`.
    - The top level MUST contain `nexus_recommendation`, `minimize_interest_plan`, and `maximize_score_plan`.
    - **MATH IS LAW:** The sum of `amount` in each `split` MUST exactly equal `payment_amount`.

    --- EXAMPLE OF PERFECT OUTPUT ---
    ```json
    {{
      "nexus_recommendation": "Avalanche Method",
      "minimize_interest_plan": {{
        "name": "Avalanche Method",
