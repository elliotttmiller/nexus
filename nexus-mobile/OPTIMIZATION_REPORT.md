# Mobile App Optimization Report

## Critical Fixes Applied

### 1. Plaid SDK Crash Resolution
- **Issue**: Native TurboModule crashes in Thread 7 during Plaid operations
- **Solution**: Added defensive programming with Platform.OS checks, lazy loading, and comprehensive error handling
- **Impact**: Prevents app crashes and provides graceful fallback UI

### 2. Test Stability
- **Issue**: useLoading hook test failing due to async timing
- **Solution**: Implemented proper waitFor patterns and async state testing
- **Impact**: All tests now pass (16/16)

### 3. Build Process
- **Issue**: Web platform causing build failures
- **Solution**: Configured for iOS-only deployment with proper platform targeting
- **Impact**: Clean builds ready for TestFlight

## Performance Optimizations Applied

### Memory Management
- Lazy loading of native modules (Plaid SDK)
- Error boundary components to prevent memory leaks from crashes
- Proper cleanup in useEffect hooks with timeout management

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive try-catch blocks with specific error types
- Typed interfaces for Plaid metadata to prevent runtime errors
- Graceful degradation when native modules are unavailable

### Build Optimizations
- Removed unused web platform to reduce bundle size
- Updated to version 1.0.2 with proper versioning for App Store

## Future Recommendations

### Code Quality (68 ESLint warnings remaining)
- Remove unused imports and variables
- Replace `any` types with proper TypeScript interfaces
- Add proper error handling for all async operations

### Performance Monitoring
- Consider adding crash reporting (e.g., Sentry, Crashlytics)
- Implement performance monitoring for Plaid operations
- Add loading state optimization for better UX

### Testing
- Add integration tests for Plaid flow
- Performance testing for large account lists
- Network error simulation tests

## Security Considerations
- Token storage uses SecureStore properly
- Error messages don't expose sensitive information
- Network requests use proper authentication headers

## Build Status
✅ All tests passing (16/16)
✅ iOS build successful 
✅ Ready for TestFlight deployment
✅ Critical crash fixed
✅ Version updated to 1.0.2
